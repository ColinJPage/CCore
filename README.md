# CCore

CCore is a custom package for Unity 6 written by Colin Page. It contains utilities and common classes used across projects.

Please be aware that many included classes and functions lack documentation. This package was originally created for private use, and adding clarity is an ongoing process.

# Highlights
### 📨 VariableSO and VariableReference

Inspired by [a talk by Ryan Hipple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk), a VariableSO is a ScriptableObject that contains a piece of data. This value persists, can be easily referenced, and notifies subscribers when changed.
 
### 🧮 ModVariables

A ModVariable consists of a "base value" and a collection of "Modifiers" that alter the returned value. This allows multiple systems to influence the same value without interfering with one another.

### 🚩 Events and EventSOs

The Event class is built off of C# Actions and provides a friendlier interface for subscribing/unsubscribing functions.

### 🔊 SoundSO

A SoundSO represents a sound effect with parameter ranges to add variation when played (volume, pitch, spatial blend, etc.). When a SoundSO is played, SoundManager instantiates a new AudioSource to play it.

### ☑️ State Machines

An abstract state machine and states are defined with the hope of being highly reusable.
